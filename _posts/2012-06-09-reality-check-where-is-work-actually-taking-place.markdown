## Reality Check: Where Is Work Actually Taking Place?

Every morning at work I am asked what I did the day before. And every morning I have to say: " I'm sorry. I don't remember."

That is not because of a badly covered hangover. At least not always.


It is because of time I spent listening to people talking about things that aren't of any or only little interest for me and my job.

In my job I have tons of meetings. Around 30% of my time at the office I spend in too cold rooms lost in endless discussions. Number still increasing.  

I despite this for several reasons. To name just a few: it bores me to death, it's amazingly inefficient and the output is marginal.  

The truth is: it isn't my job itself that demands this amount of coordination. I am not a manager.

I just work for an ordinary mid-sized IT-company in an ordinary scrum-team. That means we by definition have specific [meetings that come with the scrum-process][1] ( there probably will be a discussion of that in an upcoming post but I'll spare you for now).

As far as I'm concerned neither the job I'm holding nor the company I'm working at aren't abnormal dysfunctional. They are probably perfectly regular in their processes and structures. Nevertheless I see people getting frustrated, cynical, burned out.  

And this is not so much because of stress. The people I work with rarely work more than 8 hours a day and the team spirits are quite high. It's not a start-up any longer and so isn't the working attitude - at least half of the developers have children and family on their own.

So, what causes the increasing displeasure?  

Let me be honest: this is one of my favorite subjects. I'll stress that again and again.   

Today I just want to focus on meetings. They are just one problem in the working environment, others I will go further into tend to be i.e. structures and processes, bonus systems and (lack of) compensation.  

But for today let's have a look at meetings.

The meeting culture is the dark side's equivalent to the communication culture. Usually it's thought of two things going hand in hand, being best friends for life, being maybe - at least from some manager's point of view - one and the same.  

Communication is crucial. Especially when it comes to [immaterial labour][2] (respectively [affective labour][3]) communication is not only interacting with other people and passing information but producing feelings and of course, producing one's self: displaying and selling yourself as a whole.  

Over the last years we saw the rise of self management and holistic entrepreneurship - you don't only sell your work but your personality - not only in startups but in big and settled companies as well. Today you usually won't only be hired because you have good technical skills but because of your fascinating personality. Or because you know the right people, but that's more or less the same.  

> ##right## Befriend your colleagues. Consider your team as your best buddies.  

Of course, to some extend that makes perfectly sense. If you work in a team - and nowadays people usually do because it's still state of the art - you'll want your colleagues to be team player. HR will make sure you'll even consider to have a drink with them afterwards. Because the perfect employee doesn't feel like an employee at all. Feel like home, gather with people you like. Do stuff you love and even get paid for it. Befriend your colleagues. Consider your team as your best buddies. 

What's interesting is that all this _personality/soft skills-beat-hard skills-phenomenon_ found its way into many other work environments by now. Still, surgeons need specific certificates and have to operate, and still, programmers must be able to read and write code. What changed is that the technical skills moved into the shady background whereas originality and personality (including: what are you doing in your free-time? What are your hobbies? Who are you connected to?) became more and more important.

And they became more and more important on the world of endless meetings. Seriously: a two-hour-meeting without at least one clown is not only dull but dangerous. People put together in a room, boring themselves to death can be quite unpleasant for a company. Therefore the company has two opportunities: hire more clowns, decrease number of useless meetings.  

But I'm afraid I went to far ahead.

The basic idea of holding meetings is getting and releasing information. The assumption is that everybody has to be informed thoroughly in order to do his/her work perfectly.  

In the ideal world this would mean that everybody _can share_ his or her thoughts on the topic, _is_ informed accurately, and can consequently _handle_ his or her tasks efficiently.   Since we (by far) do not live in that ideal world there are a few errors hidden in this sentence. 

## Newsflash: Meetings are not open-mic-sessions.  

I admit, this one probably is highly dependent from the people you work with or the company you work for. Some might appreciate your open words and even encourage you to do so, others - and that so far has been the majority I heard of and witnessed with my own eyes - will have a fixed result even before the discussion starts. Therefore the employee still can share his thoughts but it doesn't really matter.  

_We already booked that bloody campaign, so please stop your rant, Jim._                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           

## Meetings do not necessarily circulate information.   

If you want to exchange important news, talk to the person concerning. If you want to loose important aspects, hold a meeting. (Personally, I recommend to invite at least 6 people of 4 different departments.)  

Besides, it's not only about keeping it small (and short) but about the _right_ people.  Because usually a customer care agent - even if he's a big boss - cannot really contribute to a technical question even if he is really annoyed with a specific bug. Talk to him, ask for the specific problems he and his colleagues experienced and inform him about the fix. End of story. 

## Meetings do not automatically lead to responsibility assignment.  

If you want something to be done, do it or talk to the person who can. Make sure both of you understand what has to be done and when.  

(This is a tricky one. Because this rule demands a structure in which you actually _can_ make decisions on your own. If you need clearance from one ore more authorities for every decision you'd like to make, you have a problem. Because obviously that will result in even more meetings.)

## Holding a meeting does not mean getting the job done.  

Imagine: you passed the right information to the right person, our superhero. Still, there is no guarantee that the problem is solved efficiently. Why is that? 

It's because of probability. I won't go into maths here, but probably everybody who ever worked in a company that has a thing for meetings will know that one: one meeting is barely enough. In fact, you have to bend time to understand the concept of meetings: _after_ the meeting is _before_ the next one. Every meeting can be seen as a preparation for the next one, the ultimate one.  

Furthermore, sitting in conference rooms clearly pulls you away from your actual work sitting and ageing on your desk. In other words: Sitting in meetings won't increase your productivity. As a matter of fact, you'll be more stressed, less focused and actually wondering in the evening what you really did - and wondering even more that you actually _did_ something.

Just to make something clear: I love discussions. I love sitting around with nice people and chitchat. But this - as I see it - is nonsense.  

Quite often these ~~sit-ins~~ meetings  aren't discussions at all because the bottom line has already been set beforehand. The information flow is usually bumpy and the gained insight is intriguing little. Therefore the actual outcome - notably when you take the time people spend in meetings into account - is quite disappointing and frustrating.

It could be better.  

Why not skip the whole thing for a while and see what happens? I'm pretty sure there still will be communication and there still will be coordination - but less structured, less defined, less formalized. Maybe, hopefully more to the point.

Unfortunately, most companies won't have the guts to try something new unless its outcome is proven and measured and approved by whosoever. So maybe the employees should start themselves and apply a few simple rules:

* hold less meetings;

* invite less people but inform everyone who should be informed about the decisions made afterwards;

* if you cannot avoid longer meetings completely because your opinion on a subject is needed desperately, tell them to call you in whenever they are ready for your input.

Okay, there are meetings you have to attend on a regular basis. Those aren't designed as information-drive-ins but are frameworks for discussions (e.g. the Retrospective-meeting in the SCRUM-process or weekly team-meetings). They usually aim to improve current processes.   

Therefore your undivided attention and presence is required. Even if you don't have anything to discuss nor to add to a discussion about whatsoever.

So maybe, even though I think of meetings like the retrospective as a potentially useful tool if used in a reasonable way, we could just skip those meetings as well and make them optional. Not saying that they should be hold and whoever feels like it can stop by, but changing the routine: The meeting should only be held if one or more person(s) feel the need to talk. If nobody has anything of interest, it won't be held.  

This will not only give you more time for your actual work but it will meetings more interesting. 

## Let's call it the _Meeting-on-Call-Strategy_.

Are there risks? Won't we loose information?  

No, probably not. First, usually information is not predominantly passed on in meetings anyway. Second: if it _is_: congratulations! Your meetings are meaningful!  

Will there be too little meetings? Will we stop talking?  

Doubtfully so. The not-talking-anylonger-part is totally up to you but to my knowledge the talking in meetings is usually done by the same few guys anyway. And they probably won't stop.  

In case you used meetings for socializing aspects: well, you can still do that. And now you can at least pick the topic. 

How to do it?  

Understand responsibility. Whoever wants to hold a meeting is responsible for the agenda, the timeframe and the tracking of results afterwards. 

Avoid meetings. Pretty much everything that has to be discussed has far better chances to result in something useful if done so informally. Best part: people will even remember what they did the other day if they didn't spent their time in end- and pointless discussions.
