"Hi. Have you taken care of \[any recurring task that is _not_ your responsibility\]? Or did you forget?"  
"Eh... no. This is Michael's task. Shouldn't you take over when he's ill?"  
"Hm. But Tom said, you would usually do that."  
"Eh... no. I only did it once when Michael was on vacation and nobody else did. Not exactly _usually_."  
"Hm. Can you do it?"  
"Yeah, sure."  

This is how I get promoted. Joke. This is how I get more tasks. More things on my list. And less time to do the other stuff I am supposed to do at work.

There are a couple of tasks that aren't my job but I took care of them sometimes. Usually I did it because no one else thought about it or I had some spare time and helped out. Very soon, I talk about _after one or two times_, it was clear to some people that these were my tasks. If I didn't do them, nobody would. And, by the way, "why haven't you already done it?".  So they didn't thank me for filling in but assumed I didn't keep up with my tasks.  

Since I already have my hands full and a lot on my mind anyway, that doesn't diminish my stress level.

Yeah, well. Take some yoga classes, then. Aren't we all stressed out to a certain amount?

Yoga classes might even help. But I prefer to relate to this problem as a sociological one, not as solely psychological.  

What I see here is a chain reaction.  

I am stressed. I try to do my job but I have problems to focus. Other people, other problems demand my attention. So the problem of not getting anything done is not only [meetings that kill my workflow][1], it's the stress itself. Not only mine but the one of others.  

It is about stressed people around me.  

After they rushed me, I'll do the same to others again. Instead of doing research on my own,I'll ask my colleague, pulling him out of his work as well.

Note: the more you are rushed, the less you are focussed, the more you have to ask other people about stuff that you should / could / would know _if_ you weren't stressed. Result: You stress other people as well. They get distracted and therefore will have to ask their colleagues about stuff they should / could / would know _if_ they weren't... 
You get where I am heading at.

Why are people stressed and distracted? 

* They are under pressure
* They have to think for others (usually stressed and distracted people as well)
* They cannot focus because every other minute something or someone else demands their attention
* They can't say "No, not now."
* Their working place is - probably unintentionally - designed to increase the stress (but after all the design is fancy and clean, y'know!)

The trouble is that you feel worn out by the end of the day. What have you done during those last 8, 9 hours? Anything? Anything at all?

Write down what you actually do all day. Make a list like 

* coming to work at 9 am, 
* having a cup of coffee with Jack who told me about that new idea, 
* before even turning on my computer Anne called and asked about that task from yesterday about which we already talked but... did we eventually find a solution?, 
* helping Marvin with his excel sheet, 
* getting to my own work for about 1h, 
* helping Marvin again, 
* getting another call from Anne, 
* looking something up for Nichelle, 
* reporting about the job of mine - what was it again? - to Jean, 
* asking Nichelle something on the behalf of Jean (be their communicator, I hate it!)
* testing something for Michael,
* skyping with the folks from XYZ,
* answering Mary's mail for the fifth time (why on earth doesn't she just call me? Or better: bug someone else!),
* Lunch! Thank goodness.
* ...

Making this list will consume some of your time, yes. But it definitely will open your eyes. And if you show that to your colleagues, maybe they even start thinking about these problems as well.

The downside is that not everyone suffers from it the same way. Some people aren't stressed out at all, they maybe even enjoy to be the go-to-person. Others may have problems to focus anyway, for them this environment can be hell from the beginning. And I assume, many people find themselves in between: _of course_ you want to help your colleagues and _of course_, you want to be nice and caring and, yes, _of course_ it's nice to be the centre of the universe and stay informed about everything. But at some point it will be too much. And it's quite difficult to say "no" after you said "yes, of course" so many times before - even though it should be completely okay and comprehensible. Unfortunately, understanding usually doesn't work this way. 

I learned a couple of things from that.

First, I definitely have had to practice postponing.  
Of course, there are tasks that have to be done now. And there are tasks, that _should_ be done soon. In many cases: yesterday.  
But hold on: You cannot save the world in one day. Not even your company. Not even your own life if you work in an environment that disables you and rushes you all the time.  
So when somebody comes to me, I put his or her problem or longings on my list. I'll tell the person I'll take care of it as soon as I can. Usually it's a good idea to tell him/her a rough timeframe in which he or she can count on an answer.  
That might sound technocratic but otherwise I'll get confused and forget about the thing I am currently working on.  

Second, I do not and cannot take care of everything. For some tasks other people are better skilled or have more knowledge. I'll therefore delegate the requestor to those people.

Third, people are different. Yeah, who would have guessed. Some people can focus on theoretical physics in a supermarket, others get distracted by the central heating's humming.  
Usually I work in a large room with my team and other teams and co-workers and due to dysfunctional architecture I pick up more than I can digest. Other people cope with that by using earplugs but that doesn't work for me. Apart from me disliking it - it doesn't work for me since I have to be _reachable_ every other minute. Therefore switching to music (headphones) or earplugs does not really help to diminish my stress.  
Luckily, one team who works in another, smaller room, offered me a place. Even though my team and my boss weren't happy I made my decision clear. And guess what? My first day there was the first day in months I could actually focus on my work. Even better: when I got home, I wasn't as worn out as I have usually been for many weeks. 

Just to make it clear: this is not only a problem with many people in big rooms. There are many possibilities to design those rooms to make them _work-friendly_. That usually won't mean more glass and metal (both doesn't help reducing the noise) but more plants, maybe even wooden furniture and, yes, solid walls can really help.  
But this is discredited as not being _open_ and _transparent_. And obviously in many companies, design is only for eyes, not for ears.

So far, this room-change-experiment has only gone for a week. Therefore, drawing big conclusions from it would probably be a bit premature.  

At least what I noticed so far: I get less "Can you please ... asap" now. This is because the people who do that frequently are too lazy to come to my new room and don't bother with mails, Skype or phone calls (these communication channels would be okay anyway). Therefore they either look for someone else to bother or they do it themselves. Or, if they really need me to do their research or give them an answer or do something that only I can do, they _think_ before coming to me. And that's basically all I ask.
