## And More (Structural) Problems Regarding The Performance Feedback

Statistics are fun. Big fun. Especially when you have a knowledge base regarding statistics of _zero_.

I had my share when I picked up social science studies and even though I was far more interested in empirical research, I at least got the slight knowledge of _how not to do statistics_. Unfortunately, others didn't. Even worse: they believe in those funny numbers and beautifully designed charts.


In [another article][2] I already started this trilogy about problems coming with the holy grail performance feedback and focused on the _Who is doin' it_-question.  
This time I want to explain what kind of _technical problems_ you might experience. We can call it the _What can go wrong_-question.  
In an upcoming article, I'll focus on the _Will there be results_-question. So, stay tuned.[][4]

### Statistics, dude?

I already mentioned the [Gaussian distribution][1], HR wanted to have as a result comparing the employees' ratings. Between 1 (lowest) and 10 (highest) everybody should rate his or her performance on several tasks and the peak should be somewhere between 5 and 6 (like "performing his / her job as expected"). 

Just to have it mentioned: this is not the best or only way to display performance. Other distributions can make [sense][3] as well.

Well, my dog ate my statistics. But I understand that if you rate the average performance of, let's say, your dishwasher, you'd give it a 10 if it's doing its job correctly and scale down depending on the problems you noticed. Coming from the Gaussian distribution we would rather rate it with a 5 or 6 (works as expected) because 8-10 are reserved for _Ã¼ber_-perfomance, i.e. if it sang and danced while cleaning your cups. 

### And this is where it all went wrong...?

The performance feedback usually runs like this:  

the employee gets some forms he / she has to fill out, i.e. rate his or her performance according to several tasks.   

After the employee filled out the sheet, he or she gives or sends them to their boss (e.g. head of, director, master, vice president) who then takes his / her time to go through the notions of the employee until, a few days later, the actual performance feedback meeting takes place.  

Since the employee does not get the ratings from his / her boss beforehand as well, there is a slight power imbalance. Both can prepare for the meeting but only one has an advantage of knowledge.

In this meeting, both talk about and compare the ratings of the employee's performance. 

Let's stop here shortly: performance is not just about skills but also about behavior. We should keep that in mind.

Just to clarify: in this evaluation, the rating-game goes only one-way. Only the employee will be rated. The manager gets his / her ratings from above as well, not from the people working for him. So he is rated for his management skills by people who don't actually know his management skills. And their opinion might be nice but it probably won't make him a better manager. Does that sound familiar?  
In my book, that is a problem.

so far, I had only two performance feedbacks. With two different managers in the same company.  

To my knowledge, both were well prepared. At least one of them told me he had talked about me with my co-workers. That is quite alright, still, I'd prefer to [get the feedback from them directly][2].

In the first talk I had in January, my ratings lay between 6 and 8. This former manager, let's call him Steve, said, no one would get a 9 or 10. (I think it's fair to question those rating systems. At least to my humble understanding of statistics this doesn't really make any sense.)

In the talk I had half a year later with my new manager who we should just call Stan, my ratings changed stunningly. Now they were between 4 and 6. Have I completely messed up in my job? Did I accidentally kill bunnies? 

No. Steve and Stan just have different rating systems.   

Whereas Steve cosidered the average performance somewhere around 6, for Stan 3 and 4 were about "average" and 6 was already over-performing. 

This obviously is a problem. Not only for me but for other people as well.  
In case I have my next performance feedback with another person like Stephanie, she either will wonder how I managed to change for the worse that rapidly or she'll give me the next bunch of funny numbers. (Hint: I have free spaces here: 1, 2, 9, 10.) 

Do those numbers or the performance feedback in general will have any consequences?  
Let's skip the latter part of this question for now. All we know is that these sheets must be signed by he manager and the employee and end up at the HR department.  
And there is this _lost in translation_-problem again: will HR understand the different ratings without further explanation? Probably not. Will they wonder? And will that maybe have consequences for the empoyee? Probably yes.  
As an employee you probably wouldn't want HR to think of your performance as degrading alarmingly within months.   

For example, I work as in Quality Assurance. My performance regarding quality I rated with 8. Like: kinda good. Better than average but not heaven sent.
My manager Stan now had not only another understanding but also another rating scale. Not only was it extremely diverse from mine but also from Steve's, which was my only orientation so far. (Note: Steve gave me a 7 or 8 back then.)  
Stan now argued that my job was quality assurance anyway, and that he expected nothing less than my best. Top notch = 10 points = average = 4 points. He therefore diminished the number and explained that if I worked in another department, my rating would, of course, be higher because then my sense of quality would be special and not expected the same way. 

That left me puzzled. In the parts I thought of as relevant for my job, my ratings were pretty poor compared to the parts seen as more relevant for other jobs where my ratings were better. So in the end I got the feeling that I was obviously doing the wrong work in the right job or vice versa.

Playing devil's advocate here: Is this the way to get to a normal distribution?  
And how can you even compare data like this? How can you even consider to do statistics if the data is that depending of provider, the manager?
