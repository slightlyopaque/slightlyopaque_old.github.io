Feedback is crucial. From feedback, we learn. Sometimes, it's easily done, when, for example, your computer just doesn't react the way you expected because you hit the wrong button. Sometimes you even get a helpful error message. But there are moments, where the feedback you get doesn't make any sense or is not helpful. And this is not a problem exclusively found in human-machine-interaction.


I want to write about a few mistakes easily done when it comes to performance feedbacks. At least two points can usually found in other parts as well since I think they appear where you have general problems. Therefore these points are more like symptoms of bigger problems.

But let's start with the most obvious one: the question who actually performs the performance feedback.

I'd like to announce that my team mates are doing a great job. They are highly skilled and have an open ear when I ~~get on their nerves~~ have questions. 

On a scale from 1 to 10 I'd rate them between 7 and 9. Jeanny has a lack of knowledge, we should fix that with additional training. Noted. Action point #1.

Problem is: I cannot rate my colleagues. It is not done this way.

Over the last years the idea of the Performance Feedback found its way into more and more human resources bureaus. The idea is that you have an "ongoing process" of feedback loops. Therefore you have performance feedback talks once or twice a year. 

Hm, you might ask, isn't feedback something that should be provided like ... all the time?

Good question. And: yes, it should. 

Let's also point out some more questions:  
Who should give you feedback? Who, actually, can give you feedback?
And what does this feedback look like? And better: what should it look like?

I had my first performance feedback in January. I got some sheets of paper and had to rate my performance in around 30 questions. The scale span from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest). 

HR informed the managers who informed us that the expected statistical result was a [Gaussian distribution][1]. Think of a bell curve. This kind of distribution basically means, that the majority gathers around the middle (average performers) and a relatively small amount of standard deviation to the left (poor performers) and the right (high-class performers).  

I wrote more about the evaluation method [here][4]; today's posting will focus on the questions I assembled above.

So, who rated me?

My boss did. 

And I think that this is a problem.

The problem is not so much that I have a problem with that practice per se but that my boss is not exactly the person I really work with. I prefer to get feedback from the people I actually work with because I believe they are the best to judge how I fulfill my tasks.

Other teams they do it slightly differently. The feedback there is given by the lead developer, a person who actually works with the rated person. But even that has its flaws since lead developers usually have so many other things to do and meetings to attend that they barely sit in and work with the team for more than two hours at a stretch.

And then there is the question whether one or two big feedback talks per year really have an impact.  

In many organizations, you have monthly meetings regarding the improvement of the working processes anyway (in case you work in IT and do something like scrum: think of the Retrospective). Why don't use those meetings?  

If you don't have those meetings yet, I'd suggest to start one.  

Before you laugh: [yes, it's one more meeting][2]. Organize it beforehand, keep it focussed and to the point.

Let this be a meeting for the team, for everyone in the team to give and receive feedback for the time past (e.g. last month, last sprint, last week).

This meeting should only be attended by the team workers, no bosses or shareholders. If you think a referred would be useful, maybe make one of the members one for each meeting.

Everybody should be responsible for taking notes about the good and bad things that happened. 

Of course, this shouldn't be a blame session. Therefore keep in mind how you address your criticism. And don't forget to tell your co-workers what you like about them, what you learned from them, where they helped you out.

I think this works better than the performance feedback talks I attended so far. It's not only easier to accept critics from the people who know what you are doing but explaining to them why you did what you did makes much more sense as well. Apart from that, you can probably learn far more from them than from a person who usually only has a slight idea about your doings because he or she is busy with management stuff.

Of course, again, risking to sound completely dull: feedback shouldn't stop just because you don't have a specifically designed meeting coming up. Communication is feedback, basically. So instead of being annoyed by your co-worker's attitude, talk to him or her directly or shortly after an annoying experience with him / her. Don't wait until your anger takes over.
