Yes, yes, yes. Security and safety are important. Especially at work. A hairdresser should be aware of the sharpness of his scissors as a pharmacist should know something about the drugs he's handing out.   Every tool on our hand is only as effective as we let it be or know how to use it and most tools can be quite dangerous if misused.  

So much for the panic.


In fact, sometimes security is taken too seriously. This can - on a social level - result in overly protected areas or gated communities and fearing "the other", giving room for racism and law and order politics. 

Fortunately, this is not what we usually see at work. What some of us might have experienced, though, are IT admins who take their job (keeping the in-house used IT running and secure) very, maybe even _too_ seriously. This can lead to some fun when programmers aren't allowed to download free programs or tools they need and have to ask the admins to do it for them every time. Or if a colleague, working in QA, isn't even allowed to update Firefox to the latest version, then something is wrong. I mean, Firefox 9.0 is a nice treat which is used by 1 or 2 % of the customers, but the current version is 14.0.1 (as of today, probably they'll release the next version any minute). 

This restrictive admins' behavior leads to a "we against them"-setting which - from a social point of view - is neither helpful nor healthy. It can, though, count as a creative challenge.

Still, a pretty perverse situation has been created. The need of workarounds forces the employees to crack their own security system. And that might result in even bigger problems than just letting them install a browser update. Even better idea: trust them. There is quite a big chance that they (people working in the IT sector) a) know, what they are doing or asking for help if they don't and b) do not actually try to kill everything. Sometimes, they might even know how to use a computer. Awesome, really.
