I guess there are trillions of jokes about the question how many managers does it take to change a light bulb, to open a door or to solve similar simple tasks.   
Don't worry, I won't gather them here.  

Though I guess, there might be many flip charts, organigrams and meetings involved. And those are usually pretty good indicators for ... something.

But today I'd like to focus on these questions: Who is a good manager? Who needs a manager? What does a good manager do?


In many companies, you cannot judge by the title. Everyone is a manager, regardless whether he or she has to lead other people or just _manage_ one's self.

The _real_ managers therefore distinguish from those people through other names like _Head_ or _Director_ or _Chief_ or, whatever, _God_. The title _manager_ lost its [meaning][4].

Sometimes, manager who are now called in other names still fulfill their job as managers. Maybe, because they don't know what else to do or have no exact idea what a _Head of xyz_ is supposed to do and they just do what they did before. Maybe, they just think they are useful as managers. And they can be damn right.   
And then there a people with fancy titles and nobody (themselves included) knows what they are supposed to be doing. They might still call it "managing" but it doesn't mean anything.

So, what - or who - is a good manager? And what does s/he do?

A good manager leads his or her team. He has a profound knowledge but doesn't have to know everything _en detail_. 

She has to have an open mind for the ideas coming from her team (and other people around) and - I cannot stress this enough - has to be a badass when it comes to that team.   
He is their (the employees') coach and lawyer but not their friend. (He can be but this usually is pretty difficult, specific post about that is coming up soon.)   
She has to be as honest as possible and must not be more na√Øve than her team. If she cannot keep promises because she doesn't own a budget, she _doesn't make_ promises.   
He (probably) has a profound knowledge and is concerned about missing knowledge within his team. He therefore seeks to qualify the employees, either by spending money for trainings or he provides and organizes those trainings by himself if the budget is already gone (or non-existent).

Does everyone or every team need a manager? 

No, absolutely not. The more self-organized a team, the less these people need a manager. But if the manager is good, he won't hurt and can even help by getting stuff out of the team's way. If he isn't, he'll find himself being the problem standing _in_ their way.

But maybe it isn't the workforce longing for a manager. Maybe it's the management on top. Maybe, the company's or department's boss is just too busy with big business plans or workshops or just doesn't want to deal with "the people". Maybe she has not even an idea of their job. Or maybe his department is too big and he fears to lose control. Or maybe, she just needs one specific face that embodies "the IT crowd!" or "those Marketing idiots!".

And then, sometimes, you have a full bunch of those faces. They are highly skilled and even better paid but they aren't of any use for the people they are supposed to _manage_. Their knowledge - that thing, why they got that job in the first place - is lost, they won't or can't use it. They sit in meetings or strategy workshops, giving and listening to the same talks over and over again. 

They don't manage. They represent. And report.

Their only purpose in there is to _be_ that specific face for the boss (e.g. CTO, CFO, president of X ...) who needs the warm feeling of security and control. And who, to some extend, is a manager itself. Or used to be. Or should be.

Of course, this is only one scenario. And yes, a bad one. But not totally uncommon, right?  

And there are still questions to answer:

* Who gets to hire or fire employees? 

* Who deals with [externals][2]? 

* Who decides about [wages][3]? 

* Who takes care of problems within or between the teams?

There are companies like [Valve][1] which state that every employee is qualified and trusted to do those things. Alone. I don't know whether Valve's statements reflect their actual actions but one thing is for sure: a company has to trust its employees and in order to make them _feel_ and _act_ responsibly _give_ them responsibility.

Otherwise the employees will change. That is a question every company has to ask itself: what kind of people do we want? (It's the question after: what company do we want to be?)  
Do we want self-organizing, active people who have many ideas (and strong opinions) or do we opt for people who do what they are asked for but have to be led / managed? 

So, how many people does it take to manage other people changing a light bulb?
And how many of them are occupied with measuring their progress and reporting to another titled person?
