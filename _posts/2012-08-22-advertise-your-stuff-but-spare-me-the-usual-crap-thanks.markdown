Probably the most important thing next to constant development of new stuff for your product / your website / your company is to show it. 

Yes, you can show it your colleagues. Can't hurt that they know what they are supposed to sell, right? 

But you could also show it to your customers. Crazy idea? You do it already? Wow.


There is the expensive way like TV advertisement or posters or website banners but it can be way easier and cheaper: write a damn blog. Post something on your website. Go for info layers or even pop ups if you like. (Though... maybe not the letter.)

But: go out and tell. 

It always baffles me to see how much effort and money went into new projects and when they are ready, there is only a "poof", no "BOOM!".

It's like "Hopefully nobody will notice that we did that thing!". But then: _why_ did you? And wouldn't it be great if your new amazing feature was - like - _used_? And wouldn't that be the best advertisement of all kind if your customers actually said "Yeah, this is by far the best company / product / website because they regularly come out with hot new shit!". 

I see that you need specific marketing for specific targeting groups. And often, the customers a company already has, aren't one of them. They are forgotten. But certainly not dispensable. Therefore better keep them in mind. And happy.

Let's have three simple rules here:

* Advertisement on TV or somewhere in the internet or in magazines should tell the targeted audience several things. One of them has to be: come to us. Visit our website. There you'll learn more about us and our fantastic product.

* When the interested visitor is on the website, he or she wants to find out more. No problem! We have our info pages about the product ready and a blog where we post all the new stuff we developed and released frequently. 

Bonus point: this blog is interesting for our already-customers as well. 

And no: it will not feed competing companies. They have other methods. But it might raise the stake and force them to produce something new once in a while as well. 

* Listen to your customers. Interact with them. They are the people who use your product, therefore they probably have a few good and several not-so-good ideas how to improve it. Think about those ideas. Focus on your existing customers. If they are happy, they'll advertise for you. If they feel fooled, you'll get a probem. Sooner or later.
