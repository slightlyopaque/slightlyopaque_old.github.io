Working with the scrum process has its benefits. Every three weeks the team estimates how much work the new feature requests will mean and decides how to do them.   
It is _agile_ because the sprint only runs for a specific amount of time (e.g. three weeks) and therefore the planning of new features don't have to be done months in advance.  
It means _agile_ because the sprint length give the shareholders the opportunity to push new ideas to the developer teams within weeks and have those ideas worked out into usable new features within the sprint length.

This process can be called _agile_. And then, for example, scrum. 

Other processes should be named otherwise to minimize confusion.


Agile does _not_ mean that a team or a team member has to do whatever a product owner just dreamt of the night before. 

It does _not_ mean "Build a new homepage today" and we'll have it up and running in the evening. It does not mean QA shall test but give a shit about their results. 

It does _not_ mean working on and testing this new feature without having any idea what to expect due to the absence of a story, acceptance criteria, design, and, yeah: time.

It does _not_ mean to stop the world moving and acting like you have the most immediate hotfix ever to deploy. That just does not work.

The results are pretty predictable:

* The developers will be stressed extremely.  

* The QA will get cynical about the product since every button they hit is followed by an exception. 

* The developers will be stressed even more.

* The QA will, after some time, stop reporting small issues since they were told that these weren't showstopper. 

I assume, nobody really cares for a self-censoring QA. But that's what you get. In addition to depressed developers. 

No, wait. 

After some time you won't have to deal with them any longer.


It can be done like that. Sure. But that's not agile. That's killing the spirit of everybody involved.
