< attention: rant >

Word of advice: If you want to work in a _kindergarten_, treat your employees like children. If you prefer to work somewhere else, treat them differently.

Sounds easy? Well.

It is the small things that show what you think of your employees and whether you trust them. Let me give you an example:

Imagine a [meeting][1] that your team (e.g. a team of developers) holds once in a while to show the other teams / departments what you accomplished during the last weeks or months. Let's call it a [_review meeting_][2]. It is a meeting with and for people you know and work with.   

Remember that.

So, you show your stuff. The audience likes or dislikes the performance. Will the audience judge you and your team by a boring presentation? Will the hellmouth open if your projector is on strike?  

Hell, no. That's crazy! - You'd think.

And you were wrong.

Nothing, _nothing_ is more import than this meeting. Say the managers. 

Let's go back. Who is this meeting for? 

Primarily it was a meeting hold by the team. It was a meeting, which they used to show what great things they built during the last development sprint. In the beginning it was for the team to show the stakeholders that their demanded features were ready and working now. The team got ~~hugs and standing ovations~~ some clapping and went off to work again.



That changed. 



The meeting gained in importance. And now it's not any longer about the presented features but about the presentation itself.



Therefore, some people had an idea. Why not have a rehearsal before that meeting?   

In that rehearsal meeting (called: dry run) everybody who wanted to present something told the others about it and they came up with an order and clarified what equipment was needed.   

After some time, they prolonged that dry run-meeting and actually _rehearsed_. Everybody who wanted to present something had to present it to this group of presenters at first.  

That still didn't please everybody. Still, sometimes the projector sucked or some guy had to search for words or couldn't give the most sophisticated answer ever to a random question during the review. Therefore, some manager came up with another idea. Why not hold another rehearsal _before_ the dry run?  


And they did.   

And did this improve the presentation in the review?  

No. Guess what: It sucked. No, the presentation was fine, smooth, very eloquent. Unfortunately, the presented features were not. They were buggy.  

And since everybody was so busy with rehearsing and doing PowerPoint presentations (!), nobody had time to test and fix these rather important problems.


No, that's not funny anymore. This is bitter.


In the end, highly skilled people, e.g. developers, sit in several meetings to prepare a stupid PowerPoint presentation (!) for another meeting.   

Shouldn't they be doing something else? Like: developing? Fixing bugs? Creating crazy new features?

These people went to college and university. They probably gave a couple of presentations all by themselves.   

And yes, they still might suck. But that is not what they were hired for anyway.   

So let them focus on what they do best: coding. And either we can stand a boring or exciting review regarding their work and give feedback afterwards ("awesome!", "boring!", "too long!", "too short!") or we should let it go. Or maybe somebody else is interested to take over. Maybe a manager.   
Bonus: S/He'd be used to those kind of presentations _and_ would therefore turn grey to sparkling colours _and_ the developers could actually work on something that can be shown.

Just one thing: Dear manager, please make sure you dedicate the hugs and standing ovations to the team. Anything else would be kindergarten.

Thank you.
