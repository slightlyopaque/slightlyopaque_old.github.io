##Don't You Talk About Numbers, B*tch


Write a hundred times:  
Do not talk about money. Do not talk about money. Do not talk about money. Do not talk about money. Do not talk about money. Do not talk about money...  
At least: not at work. With your colleagues. Never. Ever. 

Why?  
Simply because:    
_"It just doesn't work that way here, baby."_ Oh. Really? Why is that? Can we change it? 
_"If you do, we cannot give you that raise."_ Yeah. Really? (I love that one!)  
_"Others might get envious."_ Ah! Well, let me think about _that_...  

It is not that easy. It's a lie. Every one of them.


Let's think about these sentences for a while. 

_"It just doesn't work that way here, baby."_   
Oh, okay. And why the hell not?

_"If you do, we cannot give you that raise."_   
This one's really nice. I'll come back to that later.

_"Others might get envious."_  
Yeah. Because we are still those droll small people - usually called kids - who want _that-damn-pink-lollipop-because-Matha-Louise has one, too!_.

Or maybe not.   

Maybe these _others_ get envious (or furious) for a pretty good reason. Because they are underpaid. Doing the same job should more or less result in the same amount of money (to some extend depending on variables e.g. the years spent with the company, age, experience).

So if a company is trying to be as intransparent as possible regarding their employees wages this is probably because they differ extremely. 

What about some transparency, guys? Would it hurt?  

Yes, it would. It would mean a shift in the salary discussions.

A shift away from Zelda _guessing_ what she can demand to earn as much as her colleagues to _knowing_ what Timothy and Jenny get each month for their work. Zelda could therefore be far more specific in comparing their work and responsibility to hers and she'd probably articulate her request more explicitly.

Apart from the _"others might get envious"_-trope, I collected a few more reasons why we should never discuss our wages with our colleagues.

1. Others might get angry. Or cynical. Or they'll start laughing. Desperately. Because maybe your salary is a farce. Maybe you are grotesquely underpaid. And what you always assumed shapes in reality: others, doing more or less the same as you, get far more out of it.

2. It is also possible that you learn the fact that the gracious offer you just got hasn't been _that_ gracious. And the excuses and explanations that came with it maybe weren't _that_ truthful and honest. You might even learn about expenses for useless crap while you are waiting for your promised trainings. Inconclusively.

3. Then you also might learn about other stories your colleagues have heard in their salary discussions. Like "you are the only one who'll get this pay raise and we are sorry that it's so poor". 

4. And then there are the dark and scary talks indicating the end of the known world in case you'd misbehave. They usually start with something like "See, this is highly confidential. You must not talk to _anybody_ about this number, see? No one must know it, only me and you. But if you talk to anybody in this company about it, we have a problem. You know, this is my trust in you. So don't spoil it."   

This is, personally, my favorite. It is a variation of the one I mentioned above: _"If you do, we cannot give you that raise."_   
It combines a crude threat with the softness of disappointed warm feelings. Only that it's not.   
The manager I have this conversation with should not pretend that we have any kind of emotional bonding that we have not. And, yeah, he better should not bore me with useless threats. At least in [Germany][1] the clause in the employment contract forbidding the employee to talk about his or her wages is invalid and cannot be enforced.

There are probably hundreds of ~~good and~~ bad reasons more why you should _never_ talk about money at work. With your colleagues. You might get angry. And start a revolution. Or at least: fight for _some_ transparency.
