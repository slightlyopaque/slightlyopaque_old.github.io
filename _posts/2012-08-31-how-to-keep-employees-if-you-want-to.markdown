Every company experiences a certain fluctuation of their employees.  
Some people go, _seek new challenges_ as it is often called (but probably they are just bored), some get fired, some come on board and some stay. 

So far, so common.


If a company experiences the leaving of more interesting and skilled people than they are able to attract in the same time, they have a problem. 

But hey, here are some pretty ordinary ideas how to prevent this.


# How to keep your employees:

* Pay your employees at least adequately.  
Yes, money is not everything. But it is something. And people usually need money to buy stuff. Apart from that, money works quite well (but not exclusively) as a sign of appreciation.
* Give your employees responsible and interesting tasks.  
Show them your trust ( - assuming you trust them. If not, you might have a problem). Give them the possibility to fail - and to learn.   And acknowledge this progress afterwards (hint: new interesting tasks and money might be useful).
* Give your employees time and space for improvement.   
Provide trainings or let them educate themselves. Let this be languages, astrophysics or programming. If it relates to their jobs, fine. If not: they might teach you something.  
* Listen to your employees.   
They might not only be fantastic in their jobs but might also have good ideas regarding other topics. Take them and their ideas seriously. (And no, you don't have to do develop every idea coming from that guy in finance. But at least: think about it.)
* Make your employees feel comfortable.  
Ask them how they want to work.  
They should know best. If your office moves, let them be part of the planning. They'll know better how the rooms should be shaped and how the people shall be arranged. Ask them continuously: What bothers them? Can they focus on their work or is there anything interfering with it?

Of course. There is the possibility that you aren't interested in actually _keeping_ them. Or you'd maybe even like to BUT ...  
To help you decide what you really want (and how to achieve it), here's your 101 of

# How to get rid of your employees:

* Don't link the tasks your employees work on to the money they earn.   
Remember: a responsible task is reward for its own sake. Only materialists would want money for it. (Since we are on it: better don't give them responsibility; see: _Oh, don't trust your employees_)
* Don't stick to promises too closely.   
Yeah, you or somebody else _might have_ said something about this pay raise or that promotion but, well, it was never meant _that_ way.  
Keep in mind: your employees are your enemies. They only want to misunderstand you and your good intentions. 
* Do not listen to their ideas.   
They don't know better. So, don't ask for their opinions, too. It's a waste of time. 
* Oh, don't trust your employees.   
They might burn down the place. Better: control them. Constantly. Even better: Make them control themselves. Force them to document every step and rate every token action.
* Do not appreciate your employees' commitment (too much).   
Yeah, saying thanks and stuff is fine but don't feel urged to change anything else. Night shifts are good for morale, aren't they?
* Do not give them any possibility to ascent and develop themselves. Keep them in their secure small place with their small tasks.
* Don't make your employees feel at home.  
It's the office, goddammit! If they like flowers, they should work as gardeners - duh!
