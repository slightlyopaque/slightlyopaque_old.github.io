##Buzz Word Galore


Language is a difficult thing. It can be used to describe a phenomenon accurately or to make a picture swing. 

Quite often though, it is the speaker or writer who is used by the language, it seems. 

This is usually the case when s/he found a new buzz word.   


Those expressions are often shiny, sometimes a bit rough but very soon they are so smooth (due to excessive use) that everybody can write them backwards and use them continuously without any deeper understanding of their meaning.   
In fact, the _use_ itself is often seen as _proof_ for the knowledge. 

Hence, you sometimes can find this in job advertisements as well:

_"You can use "agile", "process", and "documentation" in one sentence and feel comfortable with it."_ (seen [at XING (cached)][1])  

Yes, the applicant probably should have read (or heard about) the [agile manifesto][2] at some point in his or her life. I get it. Still. I am pretty sure there are people outside who can build sentences with many shiny buzz words _and_ there are people on the other side of the street actually _building_ cool software and _working_ in teams (may them be organized in one agile way or another).   
Those people, I would argue, aren't necessarily the same. And if a passionate developer could chose the team mate whom s/he'd rather work with, I guess I already know the answer.

These people may lack the _commitment_ to discuss the latest _KPIs_ and call in _meetings_ to talk about the _awareness_ regarding the _mission statements_ and file some _lessons learned_ to _mash-up_ a new _cloud-based_ _strategy_ but ... they at least help to increase the _performance_ and _availablity_ of the application or website. As long as they actually _can do_ some work, that is.

The problem is that those expressions often don't have a specific meaning - or maybe _did have_ one originally but _lost_ it over time.   
What I talk about using the word _agile_ probably differs from a reader's understanding of the same word. This is because we share the same language (to some extend) but not necessarily the concept. We both know the buzz words and how to spell them but their meanings are too vague to discuss them properly.  
Quite often _we ourselves_ probably don't even know what we mean exactly and are therefore pretty pleased that we don't have to explain our understanding of an expression already dancing in the room for several minutes, hours or days to others.   
It would reveal our faking.  
At the same time, it would reveal the necessity to discuss these shiny words and fill them with an actual meaning. 

So, my dear people who create this kind of job ads: why don't you write in straight sentences what you _really_ expect from an applicant?  
This could save some time and ennui for both sides.
