Santa slept. As every year, this was the hardest time of the year for her.   
This. Damn. Job.   
This. Boring. Damn. Job.

As every year, she overslept.  

When she finally crawled out of bed, it was already late. It had darkened, the wind was fierce, and the room was icy.  
Most importantly: it was already the sixth of December. No more hiding possible. No more sleeping. Now was the time, and she had to go out into the wildness.


But this year she wanted to make it different. Not necessarily better. Just different.  
Without crying children (because she had _accidentally,really!_ broken their toys), without big dogs chasing her out of the house (poison, do not forget poison!) and without the others. The others. Pooh.

She must think of something else. Must. Must not panic. Must focus.

So. Where was she?

Santa called in a meeting. Just a short catch-up, like: what did I miss over the last months?

"Seasons changed, people came, and moved again. Some turned into idiots, others showed character, as one might call it. But mostly it's the same."

Santa was not surprised. Yet she felt extremely tired. And bored.

After stumbling around some rotten villages and having visited every pub within five miles, she found a place to spend the night. No nightmares tonight. Only the comforting dullness of a deep and dreamless night.
