Santa started assembling the gifts. This was the fun part. Well: had been, originally.   

Nowadays she was meant to provide the exact products someone asked for.   

Since Santa had only a vague understanding of the money-exchange-concept, her errands sometimes resulted in screaming, hunting and "I will call the police, stay here, and you must never come into our shop again"-calls that made absolutely no sense at all since she was always welcome again the next year - as were all the others with their red coats and hats.  

It was very complicated and stressful.  

This was one part of her job she really disliked. But she had put some thought into this over the last months and concluded that this year, it would be different. No more shopping for crap, no more yelling at her, no more getting stuck in a crowd. Or: in crowds, since they seem to appear everywhere.  

This was another concept she never fully understood: why did these people meet outside in the cold, drink some sort of overly sugary alcoholic beverage, not even able to understand each others because of the far to loud and excessively irritating music (with bells, of course)?

This time, to prevent herself from annoyance, she would walk around these crowds - or better: avoid them in the first place.

She decided to try something new. With thought. Like the ancestors did it.  

She just needed space. Well, and an idea obviously. 

Whistling some old tune, the idea formed into something more, something, that could count as a present. 



These ideas were everywhere. They lay around on benches, in parks, some were nesting in trees. The problem was not to find them but to choose the right one.  

Over the whole year they used to appear and suddenly nobody remembered.


Santa smiled and made her whoosh. (The _whoosh_ was a special technique she had developed a few decades ago, others might call it _magic_ what is far from being correct but spares us the boring explanation of this action.)   

This showed her the ideas from which she had to choose.  _This_ was the fun part.
