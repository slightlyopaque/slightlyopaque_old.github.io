Little is known about the place Santa comes from. Some call it Santaland, others Santasia. Santa just calls it Denmark. 

Santa does not live there alone. Well, actually, she does (within a couple of miles). However she is not the only Santa living there. In fact, many do.

Usually, they get along pretty well.   Some live together, others prefer to stay alone, but they have something one might call _society_.   

At least, when they are awake.



Unfortunately, knowledge about these Santas among humans is pretty poor. Not only do adults doubt their existence what lead to many disturbing encounters in the past ("Who do you think you are, trying to get into my house at night? Freak! Take this, moron!"), the children's knowledge is far from being complete, too.   

In case they still know of Santa, they insist, there is only one. So in case they meet two or more, they call them impostors. And let's just say: There are not many allegations hurting a Santa more than doubting his or her action or appearance. Impostor. Cheater. Liar.

As mentioned before, Santa lives alone. It is not that she doesn't like the others, she just gets easily bored. She doesn't want to talk about the job all year.  

She doesn't want to be a Santa all year. She wants to differ from that role, wants to be acknowledged as something more than just a comical figure.

Therefore she leads a quite solitary life. She has a few friends or people she can actually stand, but she is not into _socializing_. She is frightened of groups. Especially of children. Noise is her enemy. As dogs are. 

Her closest friend is Sir Éphème. He is a snowman but only fools believe he actually consists of water. It is far more complex and scientists have argued for decades how and why snowpeople exist whereas only very few people actually know the reasons and circumstances but are forced to keep calm.  

It is unclear - and not important - if Santa is one of them.   

She doesn't care. She only wants to keep calm besides her dear friend.
