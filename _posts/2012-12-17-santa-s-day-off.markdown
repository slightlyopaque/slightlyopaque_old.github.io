Friday. The second best day in the week for Santa.    
The best, of course, was Tuesday, for several reasons: Usually the weather was nice and the sleep deep and healthy. News weren't as depressing as on other days. And she'd meet up with Sir Éphème, of course.

But this was Friday. Friday was different. Friday was a day for sugar-coating. And comforting. And snuggling.

Santa felt lonely. And hungry.   

She whooshed herself a chain of cookies (with chocolate and spices, no cloves), and nibbled until she felt better and a bit sick.  
She rested, smoked her pipe, and recited some old jolly limericks she had learned several years ago when she spent her summer in the south of Wales, hiking with a group of the "Finno-Irish Friendship-Department".

Later, she felt a bit lost again. And bored. And very tired.  
Absolutely no day for anything good but self-loathing.  

She made some adjustments to her home and turned it into a very smoky and slightly shabby speakeasy and poured herself a Snotchtini*. Now, _that_ was perfect!  
Santa smiled. Whereas Sir Éphème did not approve of her behaviour.

She had another pipe. And another drink, and then fell to sleep suddenly.

In the other reality which is usually misunderstood as sleep, Santa was awake.   
She went through the night, searching something.  
She felt hungry again.  
And lonely.  

And again she was fairly disappointed about the fact that her different realities sometimes didn't differ at all.
