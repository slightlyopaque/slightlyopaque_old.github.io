Gnah. 

Half of the month already passed. No. even more. Two third by today. And what did we achieve or get so far - apart from very wet and extremely cold feet?  
Gnah.  

Santa hadn't slept well and the day was already ruined. How did he managed that?  
Santa sneezed. 

*

She eventually crawled out of her cabin. Snow.   
"Hello snow", she said. "Nice to have you around."  
The snow glittered. And swirled, twirled, and whirled around her.  
"I missed you."

Santa's relationship with snow and winter in general is a peculiar one. There is respect and trust - in the sense of "you know who you are dealing with" - not always in a warm and comforting way. 

Today, she wasn't in the mood for his games.  
She went for a walk, visited Sir Éphème who was upset about something (he often was) and in the afternoon she flew a few miles with her kite (actually just a big moth) until she felt a bit airsick.

Santa remembered an old recipe she once invented. Well, maybe not invented. But _adjusted_ to her standards.  

She calls these cookies _moon pies*_.   
Not only because the blanched almond reminds her of the moon lost in darkness (here displayed by dense chocolate dough) but also because of some old love she shared with that guy above.  

But this was neither the time nor the place to think about that.  
There was work to be done.  

She thought. Whooshed. Thought again. Re-whooshed. Grinned.  
In front of her was a table full of moon pies. And her friend, Sir Épheme, was there as well, looking at her indignantly.   
He didn't approved to be whooshed but characterised moon pies as his favorite food. He therefore had a hard time adjusting his facial expression.  He didn't like to be forced to be happy. And Santa loved to do that to him.  

Well then.  
Gnah.

*Moon Pies:

1 1/2 cups flour  
1 cup blanched almonds  
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder  
1/2 teaspoon baking powder / soda  
pinch of salt  
3/4 cup sugar  
8 tablespoons butter (room temperature)  
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract  
1 (large) egg  
60 g bittersweet chocolate, melted and cooled  

Put the flour, 1/2 cup of the almonds, cocoa, baking powder and salt in a food processor / mixer and mix until the almonds are finely ground. Store this mixture temporarily somewhere else.  
Now whir the butter and the sugar in the processor for a minute, scrape the bowl and whir until sugar and butter are blended smoothly.
Add the vanilla extract and egg and process for 30 seconds, scrape and process for another 30 seconds. Add the chocolate and whir until blended and eventually add the dry mixture you stored before. Stir until you have a soft, fudgy and malleable dough.  
Divide the dough in half and form a snake of each piece of about 20 cm and 2,5 cm in diameter. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 4 hours (Santa chose overnight).  
Take them out and unwrap them carefully. Now cut the snakes into < 1cm thick rounds and press a half blanched almond into the centre.  Be careful, the cookies are still fragile.   
Preheat the oven to 190° C and place the cookies onto baking sheets (on a rack). Leave some space between them.  
Bake them for about 7 minutes or until they are slightly puffed and their tops look dry.  
Take them out and let them cool down.   
Or eat them right away.
