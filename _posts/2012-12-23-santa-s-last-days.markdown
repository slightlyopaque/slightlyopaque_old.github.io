Another week. Good morning, everyone.

After eating approximately 84 of her moon pies (recipe see [here][1]), Santa sat.  
She sat on the sofa. She sat on the bed. On a chair and on the table and nothing helped. Nothing felt _right_.  

Was there a false way of sitting? Was it something you actually could unlearn?


She got up, rang for Sir Éphème who - just as she had anticipated - was in his finest state of grouchiness and didn't appreciate _at all_ to be asked for advice.

"Go out", he grumbled, "try to move a bit. You've been sitting around far too long."

Santa shrugged. "There is so much left to do."

She instantly knew that she'd regret this statement. And of course, her friend couldn't resist to mock her in the most condescending way possible.  
"Oh, there is so much left to do, is there not? Like, for example, eat another 84 biscuits, eh?"  

Santa shrugged. "I'd have to bake first."   
She sneezed. "Apart from that, I think I'll go out now."

She prepared her broom for the trip. Unfortunately, Santas quite often lack the social skills witches have. If they are lucky enough to have a broom around, they'll have to work hard to maintain this relationship.   
Witches, on the other hand, usually have several besoms in line waiting to be used. Only really despiteful witches have to use love spells on them.  

Santa's broom likes detective novels. Therefore she has to read them to him whenever she wants his service.   
Luckily, her broom prefers the ones with some loney, usually depressed and cynical detective over the ones with several sadistic and highly skilled serial killers. Several of these books had fallen out of her shaky hands while flying, which is why they agreed on less fearsome literature.

The evening was a quiet one.   

Sir Éphème had calmed down again and helped her with her last task for this year's work: knitting a golden fleece for the next months of deep sleep.    
This was not only to keep her warm until somewhere in April or May but also to strengthen her after one month of hard intellectual work and whooshing.   
This, and a few new batches of moon pies.
