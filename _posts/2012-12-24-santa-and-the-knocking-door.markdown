This is the very last night before the Big Sleep.  

Santa has finished her work, everything turned out fine (or at least she hoped so, since she still cannot read people's minds, regardless her effort).  

This night was about waiting.   
Waiting for Sir Éphème to sing his sing-a-long songs in his darkest voice.   
Waiting for the warm wind to turn into an ice storm.  
Waiting for the drinks to kick in.  
And waiting for the knocking on her door.  

Because this was the moment the Big Sleep entered.   
This was the time to crawl under her golden fleece. The time to hibernate, to stay in bed until the cuckoos return from southern hemisphere.

Good night everyone.   
See you next year.
