Oh goodness. Not again.

This was the third night. And that meant: something was afoot. Completely wrong. Oh, disaster.

She opened one eye. Golden light. Fuzzy. Ah, the blanket, the golden fleece.   
She sneezed.   
Her left foot felt - no it didn't feel like anything. It was frozen! Frozen because the blanket was too short. And the blanket was too short because she couldn't afford more yarn. And that was because everything had become more and more expensive. And that was because - oh, capitalism, you bloody bastard! Already crawling under my blanket now?

She turned around but it was no use. She had tried that a hundred times over the last three days and nights and she was still awake.   This was a nightmare. She needed this sleep. She'd get grumpy and completely insane without it. She knew it, she had already tried. And it had been a disaster, everybody said that. At least everybody who still talked to her. And hadn't gone insane as well.

She opened the other eye. Still golden light. With a menacing sigh she pushed away the blanket. No sun, nowhere. There was light, yes. But it was the snow, illuminated by the street lights. Wow, that was depressing. So she actually hadn't even slept longer than maybe a month. Maybe two. Oh goodness. What a nightmare.

She reached out. Ah, cookies. But where was Sir Éphème? Shouldn't he check on her? 

Shivering, she removed the blanket. Squinted her eyes. Squinched up her face. Groaned. Squatted. Reached out for a cookie again. It felt cold, icy, not as crispy as supposed. She groaned again. 

There, scratching at the door. A cat? Why would there be a cat? A rat, then? Please, don't be a rat. Or a dog. Or a small pony. What a nightmare. A mouse?! Birds would be fine, or something feline, of course.    
It was neither.  

Santa's frightened and still squinted eyes met something familiar: a red, long stick. Bright orange, like a fresh fruit. Or a warning signal. Then something yellowish white. And finally black round eyes, staring at her. In excitement? Oh. No. Of course not. Disapproval, it was. As if it was here fault.   

"You should sleep."  

She groaned. Snorted. As if she didn't know that. Why was he still that annoying? Shouldn't he be nice for a change? Caring? Hugging her?

She stared at him. Had to yawn, couldn't fight it.   
Sir Éphème grinned at her failing attempt. His grin was always a bit startling, she couldn't get used to it. She smiled.   
"Cookie?"

He snorted and hopped upon the bed. Pointed at the blanket.  
"Sleep. This is not your time. You know that."  
He cocked his head.  
"Please?"

Santa mumbled. Sir Éphème pretended not to be listening. Maybe he really wasn't. She laid down, he covered her up, stuffed the blanket around her feet, hopped on the ground. Took a cookie.  
"Now sleep. I'll be here when you wake up."

Santa smiled slightly. His words had already carried her away, somewhere into the warm and golden light of summer. 

Sir Éphème whistled. A grey mouse tiptoed in, grabbed a cookie, rushed out. He lit Santa's pipe and smiled. It still felt strange, this grimace. But at some point it would come naturally, someone, who wasn't his friend, had told him.  
"You only have to practice, my friend." 

Sir Éphème took another Moon Pie-cookie. Smiled at it. Enjoyed the pipe-smoke. And started to think of something else.
