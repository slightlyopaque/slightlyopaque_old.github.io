When Santa awoke, the golden fleece lay on the ground. Her feet were bare, the left one frozen, the right one still asleep. Her head was spinning. A bad taste, dry lips. Ah. A typical Thursday morning. 

She moved her head, slowly, very slowly, and noticed the light.  She opened her eyes a bit more, grimacing with pain, already annoyed by herself.   
Someone whistled outside, maybe a bird, maybe a bird family, tearing innocent worms apart, crying for more until the parent had extracted all poor worms within a mile to feed these horrible creatures, these small dinosaurs with so infrequently blinking and usually staring eyes.     


She shivered.   
Stopped.  
Ornithophobia? That was a new one. Fitting perfectly to all her other anxieties and feelings of discomfort. Great. Really, fantastic. 

She sneezed. Obviously, her allergy caused by frightening thoughts had not improved over time. In fact, it obviously got even worse. Sneezing when thinking about birds? Come on. That was pathetic, even for her.

She reached out. Next to the bed lay a cookie that had been nibbled consistently. Mice? Under the bed? She closed her eyes, sank into the sheets again, noticing the golden fleece lying on the floor, trying to ignore her freezing feet. Sighed.

A bell rang. It was a small, bronze bell which sounded darker than expected (Sir Éphème had worked on it several times to make the sound more comfortable and pleasing) and it usually announced news. Also usually, she hated the sound, disregarding the pleasant chimes, because she hated news since they usually disturbed her in her doings. Unusually, this time was different. She considered ignoring it for a while but since her current doings had mostly consisted of frightening and annoying herself, she chose to be disturbed by the news.   

A frog, appearing out of thin air, read the news to her.  
"Good morning, m'lady. I hope your sleep has been a pleasant and restorative one. You might be wondering about your tasks for today, therefore I'll take the liberty to shed some light on this rather unnecessary question:   
Invite Sir Éphème for tea and provide a refreshment, _not_ the rotten cucumber sandwiches from last week, he demanded fresh ones: with _real_ cucumbers, neither radish nor lettuce. He might be made of snow but he is not an idiot, says he, you see, he has even written that in a note. He sounds a bit angry, wouldn't you agree? Well. Then, you have to make moonpie cookies and, since it is already after midyear, you have to do your taxes. Ha, joking. Funny, ain't I? Okay then, After you baked those cookies of which I demand a handful for myself, you have to scare some children and save the world. Again I might be joking. Who can tell, anyway? You also might consider to do something arty. Like: to kill a mockingbird, you know? That should be an easy one. Interested in any other news? Oh, yes, you are fired. Or I am, not sure. Well, bye bye, have a nice day, see ya and: yee-ha!"

She grimaced again. Quivered. Yawned. Blinked. Opened her left eye. Sighed. How did the frog manage to get from the slightly overdone British English to some similar overdone cowboy-infused idiom within only a few sentences? Neither of it came natural to him since he, of course, was French, but it was always a bit confusing and constrained her from paying attention to his message properly. What was it about? Well. Same old, same old, probably. The frog had vanished.

She bent down, picked up the crumbs and chewed. Sighed. She rolled out of the bed, ignored the cramp in her left foot and the numbness of her right foot and hobbled to the window. Sun, warm sun. Daylight.  
The frog might have been right about one thing, it could actually be midyear. Was that information in any way important to her? She picked up the golden fleece.   

A tiny orange stick appeared, and so did two very dark and very discontented eyes. She stared at them and they stared back. Seconds passed. After 1.65 minutes, the yellowish white, holding the orange stick and the dark eyes together, moved, grimaced, and revealed a comforting long and wide yawn. Santa smiled. She had won.   

Sir Éphème grunted.   
"Is it time?"  
She moved her head to the window, nodded.   
"I guess so. Long sleep's over. At least for now."  
Both sighed.   
Sir Éphème looked at her. Carefully.   
"I ate all your cookies."  
Santa nodded. Knowing. Knowing him too well.  
"So?"  
"Just saying. There ain't any left."  
Santa sighed. Crawled out of the bed. Hobbled to the window.  
The sun threw light at her. Violently. So much light.   
Santa shrank back. 
Stumbled.  
Fell.  
Fell hard on the floor. Tried to get up again.  
Stopped.  
Looked at her feet.  
Panicked.
