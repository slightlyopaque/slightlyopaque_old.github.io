No cookies, then. At least for now.      

Santa took a deep breath.  
She had done it before, several times and the air in her room was far away from anything remotely related to freshness. In fact, it had never been fresh, not even when her room was built but since she had learned that air being too fresh would cause sincere asthmatic coughing to the people who weren't used to its exposure, she always tried to lower the risk and therefore only opened the window when absolutely necessary.  
Which was usually never.


She sat up again, carefully.  
Tried to stand up.  
Tried to shift her weight from her left foot to the right one. She fell on the floor. Again.  
That obviously didn't work. She sat up again and tried to reach her right foot with her hands. She touched it. Something was very cold. She wasn't able to distinguish. Her hands were often cold and her feet regularly frozen.  
She tried again. Her right foot was numb. And it had been numb for some time now. 

She tried to tickle it. It didn't work. She kneaded it. It didn't work either. She yelled at it. It answered with silence. 
It took her some time to understand. This foot was dead. Her beloved right foot was dead. No more. Deceased. Gone forever. Well, not exactly gone. But it was of no use any longer. And she wasn't prepared for it. Well, who was, anyway, prepared for anything?

She took a deep breath again. Sighed. Turned around to Sir Éphème who just sat there, behind her, watching or not watching, maybe lost in thoughts, maybe not thinking about anything.

"My foot is dead."  
"Hm."  
Santa looked at him. Hadn't he understood?  
"My _foot_ is _dead_."  
"Hm."  
Santa frowned. Wasn't there some kind of rule to say something comforting? She couldn't remember accurately but something inside her was pretty sure there was. Or had been. Like a social protocol, an unwritten law, a common agreement.  
But obviously, this didn't apply to Sir Éphème. 

She humped back to her bed, sat down and took her dead foot off. She placed it in the matching boot and stored it under the bed. It could stay there, at least for now until she would have figured out what to do with it. She sighed. She loved that foot. Had always loved it. It was her best one. Her reliable one. Not cramped or bullheaded like the left one.  

She missed it already. Would be missing it even more in the future. Would be having issues with stability without it. Would be lacking its comfort. Its company. Would probably be falling several times on her nose without it. Would be angry at herself for not having taking better care of it.   For not having comforted it the whole time, instead always taken it for granted.  
She sighed.   
In the disparate need for comfort, she looked again at her unsettling friend.  
Sir Éphème had hopped onto the bed and sat next to her. Silently. His charcoal eyes looked at her. His little hands were slowly grabbing helplessly into the air.

"I am sorry", he said. "I think I am sorry for your loss."   

Santa looked at him. Startled. What was coming now?  
He erected himself, what basically means that he tried to stretch his snow domes. Just like cats or people tend to stretch their backs (working better for the felines, though).  
When he had reached his longest, he let himself fall to the left. 
"Do you see? I don't even have one foot. Wouldn't want one, too. Would look ridiculous on me. But my point is: You will learn. Coping, they call it, right? Like me, who can basically jump from here to there. Feet would cause me trouble, I'm sure."  

Santa considered it. Maybe he was right. Maybe he really would look ridiculous. Of course, he had never _had_ feet, therefore possibly couldn't understand the loss she experienced completely. But then again, he suffered every time he stayed in the sun too long. Or in a loud environment. With children or dogs. And he wasn't an exceptional pleasing company afterwards. But he recovered. Every time.  
And so, maybe, would she.  

She looked closely at her left foot. It looked unlike the right one, obviously. But apart from the invertedness, there was something else. There was an additional toe she had never noticed before. A small one, maybe it was new. That was possible, wasn't it? It fit quite well and, as she got up to try it out, it improved her balance (which never had been perfect anyway).  

She turned to Sir Éphème. Sighed. And smiled. He smiled back. His eyes enlarged. He knew all the tricks.  

"Ahem. These cookies you mentioned. What about them now? Please?"
