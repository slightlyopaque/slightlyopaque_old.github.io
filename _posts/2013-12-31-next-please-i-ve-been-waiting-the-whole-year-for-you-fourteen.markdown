Someone might say: 'Prrretty, prrretty cool' and he might be right. No, of course, he is. Because here are the amazing cards (on short notice) I did for some friends. For the holidays. X-Mas. That kind of thing.  And yes, my friends look exactly like that. Even the one with the funny hat.   

In case you are wondering how you would look like if you were an Easter egg (or bunny, your choice), just let me know.  


Happy New Year!
