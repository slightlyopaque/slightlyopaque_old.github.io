Some time ago I wrote about language and buzz words. Today I'll show how a buzz word turns into reality.

Another buzz word or - let's say: _regular expression"_ (pun intended) - is _Continuous Delivery_. 
In short, [Continuous Delivery] [1] usually means the ability to build, test and release new software (mostly automatically) at any time (without or only little customer impact).  

This system, if applied correctly, can be nice. I'm sure.  
What I've seen instead was an uncontrollable build-up. What has been called _Continuous Delivery_ has been _Continuous Hotfixing_. 
It was called Continuous Delivery only because of the nice ring of the _buzzing_.  
The problem is that if you only take the name of a concept but don't work with the concept completely, it might get pretty [rough][2]. 
Usually, the following happens:  

* You have a release of your new software.
* This software turns out to be buggy. Maybe it hasn't been tested completely or it has been designed faultily from the beginning.
* You'll have a hotfix. Immediate. Faster, faster, pussycat!
* You'll notice, that your hotfix leads to other problems. 
* (You might have guessed that one:) Another hotfix is in the pipeline.
* Again, you release it. 
* Since it's so easy to release nowadays, let's release the new camapign page and those bugfixes as well, shouldn't we? 
* Again, somebody takes care of it. Stress level rise within the developers and testers.
* Crap. Our new release is coming up. Why aren't we on time with that? Oh well, let's just call it _Continuous Delivery_ then. Will do good for our KPIs.
