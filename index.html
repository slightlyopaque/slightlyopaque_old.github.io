<h1>What is ... slightly opaque?</h1>

<p>
slightly opaque is the homepage of Caroline Kikisch who does several things including writing, illustrating and hacking. <br>
I work freelance, mostly doing software quality assurance and project management but I also enjoy social and cultural studies. For more information about what I do, please see the <a href="/About.html">About</a> section.<br>
If you'd rather enjoy some writing, please visit <a href="/Articles.html">Articles</a> for non-fictional texts (and rants) or meet <a href="/Santa.html">Santa</a>, a slightly atypical character. <br>
Occasionally, I write about <a href="/Hacks.html">Hacking</a> and provide the links to the Github repository where you can find the scripts and small programs I wrote. <br>

Enjoy!</p>
