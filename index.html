<p>Hello and welcome to the refurbished home of slightly opaque!</p>

<h1>What is ... slightly opaque?</h1>

<p>
	slightly opaque is the website of Caroline Kikisch. Right, this is me. <br>
	I am a writer and I work as a freelancer in IT. I do Quality Assurance, Project and Product Management and Consulting. Also, I like cats.<br>
	Currently, I live and work in Hamburg, Germany. </p>
	
<h1>So where did you hide the ice-cream?</h1>
<p>Okay. See, I am still working on this page to increase its usability and make it even more delightful. Please be patient with me. I am not the quickest coder (yet).<br>
But since you are already here, please take a look around: <br> 
In the <a href="/About">About</a> section, you'll find something about me, my work and interests. No surprise here. <br>
If you'd rather enjoy some writing, please visit <a href="/Articles">Articles</a> for non-fictional texts (and rants) or meet <a href="/Santa">Santa</a>, a slightly atypical character. 
<br> 
<p>Whatever you do, do it with joy. And ice-cream.</p>
