<h1>Who is it?</h1>

	<p>
	My name is Caroline Kikisch. <br>

<p>I am still working on this page to increase its usability but please, be patient. I might need a little longer.<br><br>
So far, please feel free to wander around. <br>
In the <a href="/About">About-section</a>, you'll find something about me. No surprise here. <br>
If you'd rather enjoy some writing, please visit <a href="/Articles">Articles</a> for non-fictional texts (and rants) or meet <a href="/Santa">Santa</a>, a slightly atypical character.
